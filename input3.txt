Three-dimensional objects are commonly represented as3D boxes in a point-cloud.This representation mimics the well-studied image-based 2D bounding-box detection but comes with additional challenges. Objects in a 3D world do not follow any particular orientation, and box-based detectors have difficulties enumerating all orientations or fitting an axis-aligned bounding box to rotated objects. In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points.Ourframework,CenterPoint, first detectscenters of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these esti mates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. CenterPoint achieved state-of-theart performance on the nuScenes benchmark for both 3Ddetection and tracking, with 65.5 NDS and 63.8 AMOTA for a single model. On the Waymo Open Dataset, CenterPoint outperforms all previous single model method by a large margin and ranks first among all Lidar-only submissions. The code and pretrained models are available.We present a center-based framework to represent, detect and track objects. Previous anchor-based methods use axis-aligned anchors with respect to ego-vehicle coordinate. When the vehicle is driving in straight roads, both anchorbased and our center-based method are able to detect objects.from voxelization and striding of the backbone network. The height-above-ground hg helps localize the object in 3D and adds the missing elevation information removed by the mapview projection. The orientation prediction uses the sine and cosine of the yaw angle as a continuous regression.
